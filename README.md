### About me

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with ~3 years of experience building
**production systems that automate real work**.

Most of my day-to-day work lives in Python and Google Cloud — designing services,
wiring integrations, and making sure things don’t break at 3 a.m.

I enjoy turning unclear requirements into reliable systems.

- Backend services and APIs (Python-first)
- Cloud Run & Cloud Functions (Gen2) on GCP
